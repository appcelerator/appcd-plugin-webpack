# @appcd/plugin-webpack

Appcd plugin to manage Webpack build tasks.

> ðŸ’¡ Refer to the [migration guide](./migration.md) for instruction how to enable Webpack in your existing Titanium projects.

## Getting started

Install the Webpack plugin globally. Appcd will automatically detect the new plugin and start it on demand.

```bash
npm i @appcd/plugin-webpack -g
```

## Configuration

You can change the global configuration settings for this plugin in `~/.appcelerator/appcd/config.json`. Have a look at the default [`config.js`](config/config.js) file to see what options are available. For example, to increase the activity timeout of Webpack build jobs to 20 minutes, add the following:

```json
{
    "webpack" {
        "inactivityTimeout": 1200000
    }
}
```

## Development

1. Clone this repo and:
    - Install dependencies with `yarn`.
    - Link with `npm` so appcd can find the plugin: `npm link`. This needs to be done with NPM since appcd only searches the global NPM modules folder for available plugins (and not the one from Yarn).
1. To start developing and recompile the plugin on changes run `yarn dev`
1. (Optional) Start the Web UI in dev mode with `yarn app:dev`.
